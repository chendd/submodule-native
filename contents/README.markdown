# Corona^~^Â®^~^ Native

## Overview 
Corona Native allows you to extend the standard Corona APIs by adding your custom native extensions.

Lua already supports the creation of new libraries via the module/require mechanism. With Corona Native, you can also add libraries that are implemented as native code. In other words, you can wrap native code behind a Lua interface so it looks just like any other Corona API (e.g. the 'display' library).

## Installation and Activation

To install and activate CoronaNative, please refer to the [Corona Native Setup Guide](https://docs.coronalabs.com/native/).
